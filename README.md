C / C++ projects assigned from computer science studies


1. Super Calculator

First college project called "Super Calculator".

The project was about solving 10 math problems. Each function in my code is called with the problem I had to solve. For each problem there were 2 tests running. First test was easy to pass basically in every problem, but the second, one had some extra testes and difficult inputs. For example 65 bit numbers for "Count_Set_Bits" function or very big numbers for "Prime_Check" function. And also very restrictive time limits.



2. Banana Tree

The banana tree B(n,k) is defined as n stars with k vertices (n>0, k>0), 
which vertices with the maximum degree are connected to one additional vertex r


3. Count 4-Cycles

For a given convex polyhedron determinate the number of 4-vertex cycles in the graph formed by the space diagonals of the polyhedron.


4. Tarzan ( TSP )

Traveling salesman problem with additional river logic ( explained inside the river distance function ).


5. Collatz Sequence

Just finding longest descending sequence in Collatz Sequence.


6. JÃ³zef Flawiusz Problem

1. Super Calculator

First college project called "Super Calculator".

The project was about solving 10 math problems. Each function in my code is called with the problem I had to solve. For each problem there were 2 tests running. First test was easy to pass basically in every problem, but the second, one had some extra testes and difficult inputs. For example 65 bit numbers for "Count_Set_Bits" function or very big numbers for "Prime_Check" function. And also very restrictive time limits.



2. Banana Tree




3. CyclesCounter
